### Absolute Pitch Training

#### Usage

Listen to a note --> Input your answer --> Receive feedback

Training record is saved in `localStorage`.

To avoid the reliance on short-term memory and relative pitch, it is recommended to train one note at a time or listen to something else in between.

#### Intro

Absolute pitch refers to the ability to name a note without external reference. (This effectively means recognizing the fundamental frequency of a sound.) This ability was traditionally thought to depend on genetic disposition and early musical training. Recent experiments [1][2] have shown that some adults *can* develop this skill. (The question remains whether they can achieve the same level of performance.)

Equal temperament means fundamental frequencies of notes are equally spaced on logarithmic scale. However, this relation is not represented intuitively under western music notation. This project uses a more "scientific" notation based on numbers to hopefully aid learning.
